# Exercise 1: accessing a relational database

# Install and load the `dplyr`, `DBI`, and `RSQLite` packages for accessing
# databases


# Create a connection to the `Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite` file in the `data` folder
# Be sure to set your working directory!
db_connection <- dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname = "data/Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite")

# Use the `dbListTables()` function (passing in the connection) to get a list
# of tables in the database.
dbListTables(db_connection)
# Use the `tbl()`function to create a reference to the table of music genres.
# Print out the the table to confirm that you've accessed it.
genres <- tbl(db_connection, "Genre")

# Try to use `View()` to see the contents of the table. What happened?
View(genres)

# Use the `collect()` function to actually load the genre table into memory
# as a data frame. View that data frame.
genres <- collect(genres)
View(genres)
# Use dplyr's `count()` function to see how many rows are in the genre table
count(genres)
?count()

# Use the `tbl()` function to create a reference the table with track data.
# Print out the the table to confirm that you've accessed it.
tbl(db_connection, "Track")

# Use dplyr functions to query for a list of artists in descending order by
# popularity in the database (e.g., the artist with the most tracks at the top)
# - Start by filting for rows that have an artist listed (use `is.na()`), then
#   group rows by the artist and count them. Finally, arrange the results.
# - Use pipes to do this all as one statement without collecting the data into
#   memory!
track <- collect(tbl(db_connection, "Track"))

track <- track %>% 
  filter(Composer != is.na(Composer)) %>%
  group_by(Composer) %>%
  count(Composer) %>%
  arrange(-n)


# Use dplyr functions to query for the most popular _genre_ in the library.
# You will need to count the number of occurrences of each genre, and join the
# two tables together in order to also access the genre name.
# Collect the resulting data into memory in order to access the specific row of
# interest
track <- collect(tbl(db_connection, "Track"))

track <- track %>%
  filter(Composer != is.na(Composer)) %>%
  group_by(GenreId) %>%
  count(GenreId) %>%
  arrange(-n) %>%
  left_join(genres, by = "GenreId")
# Bonus: Query for a list of the most popular artist for each genre in the
# library (a "representative" artist for each).
# Consider using multiple grouping operations. Note that you can only filter
# for a `max()` value if you've collected the data into memory.


# Remember to disconnect from the database once you are done with it!
